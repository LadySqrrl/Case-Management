# Case-Management

This program is intended to help manage special education case files, evaluations, and reevaluations for school psychologists. Particularly this is useful for school psychologists working in Iowa who are able to get the IEP_activemgsservice report from the IMS admin in your AEA.

The first step in this project is setting up a database. My database desing process can be observed in the Database Design Planning Notes Folder. Now that it's designed, I'll work on getting the data from my spreadsheet into the databse and expanding on the reports that are available. 

Future decisions that need to be considered are: how to display/provide the information to the user, what kind of interface to utilize, and how to ensure security. 

Additional functionality that will be addressed: connecting to Google Calendar through the API and calendaring due dates and creating task lists automatcially.
